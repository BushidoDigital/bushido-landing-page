A countryside wedding venue needed a digital presence that could handle everything from showcasing their beautiful space to managing bookings and customer enquiries.

## Chapter 1: The Foundation

We started by building a **Wagtail CMS** frontend website — a flexible, editor-friendly system that let the venue team manage their content without having to know how to code. The frontend brought their vision to life with beautiful imagery allowing customers to easily understand the venue's history and unique features..

The impact? Customer support enquiries **increased significantly** through a streamlined contact form that made it dead simple for couples to get in touch.

## Chapter 2: Evolution

Fast forward to today, and we're **rebuilding from the ground up** with modern tools:

- **Directus CMS** — A headless CMS that gives the team even more flexibility
- **Nuxt 3** — Lightning-fast SSR frontend with incredible performance
- **Modern architecture** — Cleaner separation, easier maintenance, better DX

## Chapter 3: The Booking Revolution

We're not stopping there. Currently in development:

> A **Django Rest Framework** booking system that lets couples book venue viewings and wedding dates directly online — no more email ping-pong.

**What this means:**
- Real-time availability checking
- Automated confirmation flows
- Integrated calendar management
- Seamless payment processing

The venue team gets their time back. Couples get instant bookings. Everyone wins.
