A countryside wedding venue needed a website that would showcase their stunning space and make it easy for couples to enquire and book.

## What we built

We created a beautiful, fast website that lets the venue team update content themselves — no developer needed for day-to-day changes. The site highlights the barn's unique character through gorgeous imagery and clear information about packages and availability.

**The result?** Enquiries increased significantly thanks to a streamlined contact form that made it simple for couples to get in touch.

## What's next

We're currently building an online booking system so couples can check availability and book viewings directly — no more back-and-forth emails. The venue team will have a calendar dashboard to manage everything in one place.
