When you're racing, every bit of information matters. The team needed a dashboard system that could display live data clearly, even at high speeds and under vibration.

## What we built

A complete dashboard display system with three parts:

**The display itself** — A screen that shows exactly what the driver needs: lap times, speed, gear position, engine data. Everything updates in real-time and stays readable even in bright sunlight or at night.

**Customisable layouts** — Different tracks and conditions need different information. Teams can create custom dashboard pages and switch between them instantly.

**A desktop app** — No coding required. Teams can design their dashboard layouts visually, preview them, and push updates to the car with one click.

## The outcome

Race teams can now set up and adjust their dashboards in minutes instead of hours, and drivers get exactly the information they need, exactly how they want it.
